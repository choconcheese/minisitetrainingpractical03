              <h3>Lecture Class Training</h3>
              <p>
•	Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. <br />
•	Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough).  <br />
•	Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. <br />
•	Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: <br />
o	If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. <br />
o	Which one are you most on top of? <br />
o	Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? <br />
•	Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures. <br />
